# Marketing-Mix-Model

In order to maximize sales, every company sets aside a budget for marketing and advertising. There are a variety of metrics that can be used to allocate resources. Market Mix Modelling (MMM) is a technique which helps in quantifying the impact of several marketing inputs on Sales. MMM uses the Regression technique and the analysis performed through Regression is further used for extracting insights. 

There are 2 levels of modelling for the proposed solution as described below:

    1)  Linear Regressionâ€“ To determine the behavior of different marketing channels with respect to sales and to obtain objective equation for second model.

    2)  Sales Optimization Model  
        a) To determine the minimum budget that will yield the best results.
        b) To figure out how many units of advertising we can acquire for a minimal investment.


This is the flow which I used for developing this model.
